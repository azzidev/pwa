# PWA Initial Structure
PWA stands for Progressive Web App. It is a type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. PWAs are built using common web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be accessed through a web browser. They are designed to work on any platform and provide features such as offline access, push notifications, and fast loading times. PWAs aim to provide a seamless user 
experience across devices and improve user engagement.

The above repository is a functional and installable PWA base. With this template you can create the most varied projects.

Don’t worry, the limitation of a PWA is being phased out, since its acceptance in stores such as Google’s PlayStore, Microsoft’s Microsoft Store or Apple’s AppleStore.
